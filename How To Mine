2. Extract MVis Token Miner
Inside the folder of your extracted files, there's another folder labeled tokenminer and inside of that folder is a file labeled tokenminer.ini.

Open the tokenminer.ini file in NotePad and replace the following information with your own. Notee: Do not delete any of the other information inside the file.

Add YOUR information to the following:

Host=https://mainnet.infura.io/your_api_key
RPCPort=8545
MinerAcct=0x……………….
AcctPK=……………………
TokenContract=0x012fD5049A203Df08c02FB2e0Ed15CEeD10d9ED4
GasPrice=5 

MinerAcct is your Ethereum account. (Remember to have some ETH on it.)
AcctPK is the private key of your Ethereum account. 
You will need to adjust GasPrice as you see fit.

3. Launch MVis Token Miner
After completing the steps above, open cmd window.

Browse to the location where you extracted the miner software or drag and drop tokenminer.exe into the cmd window.

Run the following command: tokenminer.exe -S -C -t 1

Note: The above command and steps are to start your miner in solo mode using you CPU (using 1 CPU thread.) You can adjust amount of threads by changing -t 1 to the number of threads you wish to mine with.
